title: Generic traversals with applicative difference lists
keywords: [haskell]
---

The Haskell library [*generic-data*][gdata] provides generic implementations of
standard type classes. One of the goals of *generic-data* is to generate code
which performs (at least) as well as something you would write manually.
Even better, we can make sure that the compiled code is identical to what one
would obtain from hand-written code, using inspection testing[^inspect-note].

[^inspect-note]: The [*inspection-testing*][inspect] plugin;
  see also the paper [*A Promise checked is a promise kept: Inspection testing*][inspect-paper],
  by Joachim Breitner (Haskell Symposium 2017).

During the exercise of building some inspection tests for *generic-data*,
the most notable discrepancy to resolve was with the `Traversable` class.

To improve the traversals generated by *generic-data*,
a useful data structure is *applicative difference lists*
([it's also been called `Boggle` before][boggle]).
It is a type-indexed variant of difference lists
which simplifies applicative operations at compile time.
This data structure is available as a library on Hackage:
[*ap-normalize*][ap-normalize].

= Generic traversals

The [`Traversable` type class][trav] describes type constructors `t` which can
be "mapped over" similarly to `Functor`, but using an effectful function `a -> f b`:

[trav]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Data-Traversable.html

```haskell
class (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable t where
  traverse :: forall f a b. Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
```

(We will not discuss the `Functor` and `Foldable` super classes.)

Throughout this post, fixing an applicative functor `f`,
*actions* are what we call values of type `f x`, to evoke the idea that they
are first-class computations.

Intuitively, a traversal walks over a data structure `t a` which contains
"leaves" of type `a`, and performs some action (given by the `a -> f b`
function) to transform them into "leaves" of type `b`, producing a new data
structure `t b`.

There is a straightforward recipe to define `traverse` for many data types.
This is best illustrated by a example. We will call this the "naive"
definition because it's just the obvious thing to write if one were to
write a traversal. That is not meant to convey that it's bad in any way.

<figure id="figure-A">
<figcaption>Figure A</figcaption>
```haskell
data Example a = Example Int a (Maybe a) (Example a)

-- Omitted: Functor and Foldable instances
instance Traversable Example where
  traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Example a -> f (Example b)
  traverse update (Example a b c d) =
    Example
      <$> pure a
      <*> update b
      <*> traverse update c
      <*> traverse update d
```
</figure>

<details class="code-details">
<summary>There are variations.</summary>

- Using applicative laws, `Example <$> pure a` can fuse into `pure (Example a)`,
  that in turn can fuse with the following `(<*>)` into `Example a <$> ...`.

- Going the other way, we can expand `Example <$>` into `pure Example <*>` for
  a more uniform look.

- `liftA2` can also be used to fuse the first `(<$>)` and `(<*>)`.

(More on that later.)
</details>

For the sake of completeness, the recipe is roughly as follows, for a data type
with a type parameter `a`:

1. traverse each field individually, in one of the following ways depending on
   its type:

    a. if its type does not depend on `a` (e.g., `Int`), then the field
       is kept intact, and returned purely (using `pure`);

    b. if its type is equal to `a`, then we can apply the function `a -> f b` to it;

    c. if its type is of the form `t a`, where `t` is a traversable type
       we `traverse` it recursively;

2. combine the field traversals using the `Applicative` combinator
   `(<*>)`.

Noticing that the only case where we need another type to be traversable is to
traverse fields whose type depend on `a`, we can define `traverse` for all
types which don't involve non-traversable primitive types such as `IO` or
`(->)`.

This is quite formulaic, and it can be automated in many ways.
The most practical solution is to use the GHC extension `DeriveTraversable`
(which implies `DeriveFunctor` and `DeriveFoldable`):

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveTraversable #-}

data Example a = Example Int a (Maybe a) (Example a)
  deriving (Functor, Foldable, Traversable)
```

You may be wondering: if it's built into GHC, why would I bother with generic
deriving? There isn't a substantial difference from a user's perspective
(so you should just use the extension). But from the point of view of implementing
a language, deriving instances for a particular type class is a pretty ad hoc
feature to include in a language specification. Generic deriving subsumes it,
turning that feature into a library that regular people, other than compiler
writers, can understand and improve independently from the language itself.

Well, that's the theory. Generic metaprogramming in Haskell has a ways to go
before it can fully replace an integrated solution like `DeriveTraversable`.
The biggest issue currently is that GHC does not perform as much inlining as
one might want.
A coarse but effective answer to overcome this obstacle might be an annotation
to explicitly indicate that some pieces of source code must be gone after
compilation.

So the other way to derive `traverse` that I want to talk about is to use
`GHC.Generics`. *generic-data* provides a function `gtraverse` which can be
used as the definition of `traverse` for many types with a `Generic1` instance.
Although it does not use the `deriving` keyword[^via], it is still a form of
"deriving" since the syntax of the instance does not depend on the particular
shape of `Example`.

[^via]: We also can't use `DerivingVia` for `Traversable`.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

data Example a = Example Int a (Maybe a) (Example a)
  deriving Generic1

instance Traversable Example where
  traverse = gtraverse
```

All three instances above *behave* the same (the naive one, the
`DeriveTraversable` one, and the generic one).
However, if we look not only at the *behavior* but the generated *code* itself,
the optimized GHC Core code produced by the compiler is not the same in all cases.
The definition of `gtraverse` until *generic-data* version 0.8.3.0
results in code which looks like the following
(various details were simplified for clarity's sake[^clarity]):

[^clarity]: Some of those details: only used `(<$>)` and `(<*>)`, ignoring the
  existence of `liftA2`; dropped the `M1` constructor;
  kept `K1` (which is basically `Identity`) around because it makes things
  typecheck if we look at it closely enough; `K1` is actually used by only
  on of the fields in the derived `Generic1` instance.

<figure id="figure-B">
<figcaption>Figure B</figcaption>
```haskell
traverseExample :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Example a -> f (Example b)
traverssExample update (Example a b c d) =
  (\((K1 a' :*: K1 b') :*: (K1 c' :*: K1 d')) -> Example a' b' c' d')
    <$> ((:*:)
           <$> ((:*:) <$> (K1 <$> pure a)
                      <*> (K1 <$> update b))
           <*> ((:*:) <$> (K1 <$> traverse update c)
                      <*> (K1 <$> traverse update d)))
```
</figure>

That function traverses each field (using `pure`, `update`, `traverse update`),
wraps them in a newtype `K1`, and collects them in a pair of pairs
`(_ :*: _) :*: (_ :*: _)`,
and then replaces those pairs with the `Example` constructor.

Clearly, this does not look the same as the naive version shown earlier.
Let's enumerate the differences:

- There are many uses of `(<$>)`, which can be fused together.

- It constructs and immediately destructs intermediate pairs `(:*:)`.
  It would be more direct to wrap the fields in `Example`.

- The actions are associated differently (`(a <*> b) <*> (c <*> d)`)
  whereas the previous two implementations associate actions to the left
  (`((a <*> b) <*> c) <*> d`).

This definition cannot actually be simplified because the applicative functor
`f` and its operations `(<$>)` and `(<*>)` are abstract, their definitions are
not available for inlining.
This definition  ([Figure B](#figure-B)) is only equivalent to the naive one
([Figure A](#figure-A)) if we assume the laws of the `Applicative` class
(notably associativity), but the compiler has no knowledge of those.
And so the simplifier is stuck there.

To be fair, it's actually not so clear that these differences lead to
performance problems in practice. Here are some mitigating factors to
consider:

1. For many concrete applicative functors, inlining `(<$>)` and `(<*>)`
   does end up simplifying away all of the noise.

2. Even if we didn't build up pairs explicitly using `(:*:)`,
   `(<*>)` may allocate closures which are about as costly as pairs anyway.

3. Tree-like (`Free`) monads are more performant when associating actions to
   the right (`a <*> (b <*> (c <*> d))`).

Nevertheless, it seems valuable to explore alternative implementations.
To echo the three points just above:

1. The new definition of `gtraverse` will simplify to the naive version even
   while the applicative functor is still abstract.

2. Properly measuring the subtle difference between pairs and closures sounds
   like a pain. Knowing that the code that eventually runs allows one to switch
   from one system (`DeriveTraversable`) to another (*generic-data*) without
   risk of regressions---modulo all the transient caveats that make this ideal
   story not true today.

3. If actions must be associated another way, this is just another library
   function to be written.


= Streamlining traversals with difference lists

The main idea in this solution is that the definition of `gtraverse` should
explicitly reassociate and simplify the traversal.

An obvious approach is thus to represent the syntax of the traversal
explicitly, as an algebraic data type where a constructor encodes the
applicative combinator `(<*>)`, possibly in a normalized form. This is a free
applicative functor:

```haskell
data Free f a where
  Pure :: a -> Free f a
  Ap :: Free f (b -> a) -> f b -> Free f a

-- This is actually a regular data type, just using GADTSyntax for clarity.
```

However, this is a recursive structure: that blocks compiler optimizations
because GHC does not inline recursive functions (if it did,
this could be a viable approach).

Notice that this free applicative functor is basically a list,
a heterogeneous list of `f b` values where `b` varies from element to element.
If recursion is the problem, maybe we should find another representation of
lists which is not recursive. As it turns out, difference lists will be
the answer.

== Difference lists, briefly

Let us digress with a quick recap of difference lists, so we're on the same
page, and as a reference to explain by analogy the fancier version that's to
come.

Here's a list.

```haskell
1 : 2 : 3 : []
```

A difference list is a list with a hole `_` in place of its end `[]`.
The word "difference" means that it is the result of "subtracting"
the end from the list:

```haskell
1 : 2 : 3 : _
```

In Haskell, a difference list is represented as a function,
whose input is a list to fill the hole with, and whose output
is the whole list after adding the difference around the hole.
A function "from holes to wholes".

```haskell
type DList a = [a] -> [a]

example :: DList Int
example hole = 1 : 2 : 3 : hole
```

Difference lists are interesting because they are super easy to concatenate:
just fill the hole in one difference list with the other list.
In Haskell, this is function composition, `(.)`.
For instance, the list above is the composition of the two lists below:

```haskell
ex1, ex2 :: DList Int
ex1 hole = 1 : hole
ex2 hole = 2 : 3 : hole

example = ex1 . ex2
```

Difference lists are an alternative representation of lists
with a performant concatenation operation, which doesn't allocate
any transient intermediate structure.
The trade-off is that other list operations are more difficult to have,
notably because it's expensive to inspect the list to know whether it is empty
or not.

The following functions complete the picture with a constructor of
difference lists and an eliminator into regular list.
Internally they involve the list constructors in very simple ways, which is
actually key to the purpose of difference lists. `singleton` is literally the
list constructor `(:)` (thus representing the singleton list `[x]` as a list
with a hole `x : []`), and `toList` applies a difference list to the empty list
(filling the hole with `[]`).

```haskell
singleton :: a -> DList a
singleton = (:)

toList :: DList a -> [a]
toList u = u []
```

== Applicative difference lists

Why were we talking about lists?
Applicative programming essentially consists in describing lists of actions
(values of type `f x` for some `x`)
separated by `(<*>)` and terminated (on the left end) by `pure _`
(we'll come back later to putting `(<$>)` back).

```haskell
pure Example
  <*> pure a
  <*> update b
  <*> traverse update c
  <*> traverse update d
```

Once we have a notion of lists, a difference list is a list with a hole `_` in
place of its end:

```haskell
_
  <*> pure a
  <*> update b
  <*> traverse update c
  <*> traverse update d
```

So constructing a traversal as a difference list of actions would allow us to
maintain this structure of left-associated `(<*>)`. In particular, this
will guarantee that there are no extra `(<$>)` in the middle.
Once we've completed the list, we top it off with a term `pure _`, where the remaining
hole expects a pure function without any of the applicative functor nonsense which was
blocking compile-time evaluation.

Let's see how it looks in Haskell. 
This is where things ramp up steeply. While the types may look daunting,
I want to show that we can ignore 90% of it to see that, under the hood,
this is the same as plain difference lists `[a] -> [a]`.

You're not missing much from ignoring 90% of the code:
it is entirely constrained by the types.
That's the magic of parametricity.

== The analogy with difference lists

The first thing to note is that since we've replaced the list
constructor `(:)` with <span class="nobr">`(<*>)`,</span> actions `f x` represent both individual
list elements `a` and whole lists `[a]`.

We will draw the analogy between simple difference lists and applicative
difference lists by *erasure*. Erase the type parameter of `f`, and anything
that has something to do with that parameter.
What is left is basically the code of `DList`, carefully replacing `f` with `a`
or `[a]` as is appropriate.[^monoids]

A first example is that `(<*>)` thus corresponds to both `flip (:)`
and `(++)`
(`flip (:)` because as we will soon see, we are really building snoc lists here).

[^monoids]: This analogy would be tighter with an abstract monoid instead of lists.

```haskell
-- (<*>) vs (:) and (++)
(<*>)    :: f (x -> y) -> f x -> f y
         :: f          -> f   -> f     -- erased
flip (:) :: [a]        -> a   -> [a]
(++)     :: [a]        -> [a] -> [a]
```

For another warm-up example, `fmap`, which acts on the
type parameter of `f`, erases to the identity function.

```haskell
-- fmap vs id
fmap :: (x -> y) -> f x -> f y
                 :: f   -> f     -- erased
id               :: [a] -> [a]
```

The applicative difference lists described above are given by the following type
`ApDList`. Similar to simple difference lists, they are also functions
"from holes to wholes", where both "holes" and "wholes" (complete things without holes)
are actions in this case, `f (x -> r)` and `f r`, if we ignore `Yoneda`.
We will not show the definition of `Yoneda`, but for the purpose
of extending the metaphor with `DList`, `Yoneda f` is the same as `f`:

```haskell
newtype ApDList f x = ApDList (forall r. Yoneda f (x -> r) -> f r)
   type ApDList f   =         (                 f          -> f  )  -- erased
   type   DList a   =         (                 [a]        -> [a])
```

== Applicative: empty list and concatenation

While simple difference lists define a monoid, applicative difference lists
similarly define an applicative functor, with a product `(<*>)` and an
identity `pure` which indeed erase to the concatenation of difference lists
(function composition) and the empty difference list (the identity function).

An important fact about this instance is that it has no constraints whatsoever;
the type constructor `f` can be anything. The lack of constraints restricts
the possible constructs used in this instance. It's all lambdas and
applications: that's how we can tell without even looking at the definitions
that `pure` and `(<*>)` can only be some flavor of the identity function and
function composition.

```haskell
instance Applicative (ApDList f) where
  pure x = ApDList (\t -> lowerYoneda (fmap ($ x) t))
  ApDList uf <*> ApDList ux = ApDList (\t -> ux (Yoneda (\c -> uf (fmap (\d e -> c (d . e)) t))))
```

Empty difference lists: erasure of `pure`, which corresponds to `id`.

```haskell
-- pure vs id, signature
pure :: x -> ApDList f x  -- Empty ApDList
id   ::        DList a    -- Empty DList

-- pure vs id, definition
pure x = ApDList (\t -> lowerYoneda (fmap ($ x) t))
id     =         (\t ->                         t )
```

Where `lowerYoneda` is also analogous to the identity function.

```
lowerYoneda :: Yoneda f x -> f x
```

Concatenation of difference lists: erasure of `(<*>)`, which corresponds to `(.)`.

```haskell
-- (<*>) vs (.), signature
(<*>) :: ApDList f (x -> y) -> ApDList f x -> ApDList f y  -- Concatenate ApDList
(.)   ::   DList a          ->   DList a   ->   DList a    -- Concatenate   DList

-- (<*>) vs (.), definition
ApDList uf <*> ApDList ux = ApDList (\t -> ux (Yoneda (\c -> uf (fmap (\d e -> c (d . e)) t))))
        uf  .          ux =         (\t -> ux (              uf                           t  ))
```

Remark: this composition operator is actually flipped.
The standard definition goes `uf . ux = (\t -> uf (ux t))`.
This is fine here because applicative lists are actually snoc lists---the
reverse of "cons"---where elements are added to the right of lists, so the
"holes" of the corresponding difference lists are on the left:

```haskell
uf = ((_ <*> a) <*> b) <*> c)  -- A snoc list, separated by (<*>)
ux = (_ <*> x) <*> y

uf <*> ux = ((((_ <*> a) <*> b) <*> c) <*> x) <*> y
```

To concatenate `uf` and `ux`, we put `uf` in the hole on the left end of `ux`,
rather than the other way around; this is why, in the definition above,
`uf` is inside and `ux` is outside.

== Lift and lower: creation and destruction

We have defined *concatenation* to combine applicative difference lists.
We also need ways to construct and eliminate them.
We *lift* elements as singleton lists and *lower* lists into simple actions.

Lifting creates a new `ApDList`, with the invariant that it represents
a left-associated list of separated by `(<*>)` (the left-associativity is why
it needs to be a snoc list). That invariant is preserved by the concatenation
operation we defined just earlier.
One can easily check that `liftApDList` is the only function in this little
`ApDList` library (4 functions) where `(<*>)` from the `Applicative f` instance is used.

```haskell
-- Singleton ApDList
liftApDList :: Applicative f => f x -> ApDList f x
listApDList u = ApDList (\t -> lowerYoneda t <*> u)

-- Singleton DList (snoc version)
snocSingleton :: a -> DList a
snocSingleton u = (\t -> t ++ [u])
```

Lowering consumes an `ApDList` by filling the hole with an action,
producing a whole action.
This is the only function about `ApDList` where `pure` from `Applicative f` is
used.
We use `pure` to terminate lists of actions in the same way `[]` terminates
regular lists. (This is oversimplified from the real version.)

```haskell
lowerApDList :: Applicative f => ApDList f x -> f x
lowerApDList (ApDList u) = u (Yoneda (\f -> pure f))

-- By analogy
toList :: DList a -> [a]
toList u = u []

-- lowerApDList vs toList
lowerApDList (ApDList u) = u (Yoneda (\f -> pure f))
                      u  = u         (      pure _)    -- erased
toList                u  = u                []
```

== Simplifying traversals

Having defined difference lists and their basic operations, we can pretend that
they are really just lists.
Similarly, we can pretend that applicative difference lists `ApDList f x`
are just actions `f x`,
thanks to there being an instance of the same `Applicative` interface.
With that setup, fixing the generic `gtraverse` function is actually a very
small change, that will be explained through an example.
We started with this result:

<figure id="figure-B-bis">
<figcaption>[Figure B](#figure-B), again</figcaption>
```haskell
traverseExample :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Example a -> f (Example b)
traverssExample update (Example a b c d) =
  (\((K1 a' :*: K1 b') :*: (K1 c' :*: K1 d')) -> Example a' b' c' d')
    <$> ((:*:)
           <$> ((:*:) <$> (K1 <$> pure a)
                      <*> (K1 <$> update b))
           <*> ((:*:) <$> (K1 <$> traverse update c)
                      <*> (K1 <$> traverse update d)))
```
</figure>

After the patch, we get the following ([Figure C](#figure-C)),
where the only textual difference is that we inserted `lowerApDList` at the
root and `liftApDList` at the leaves of the traversal. That changes the types
of things in the middle from `f` to `ApDList f`. In the source code behind
`gtraverse`, this type change appears as a single substitution in one type
signature.[^singlesub]

[^singlesub]: Except for the fact that I first needed to copy over the
  `Traversable` instances from *base* in a fresh class before modifying them.

<figure id="figure-C">
<figcaption>Figure C</figcaption>
```haskell
traverseExample :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Example a -> f (Example b)
traverssExample update (Example a b c d) =
  lowerApDList $
  (\((K1 a' :*: K1 b') :*: (K1 c' :*: K1 d')) -> Example a' b' c' d')
    <$> ((:*:)
           <$> ((:*:) <$> (K1 <$> pure a)
                      <*> (K1 <$> liftApDList (update b)))
           <*> ((:*:) <$> (K1 <$> liftApDList (traverse update c))
                      <*> (K1 <$> liftApDList (traverse update d))))
```
</figure>

Again leveraging parametricity, we don't need to work out the simplification in
detail. Just from looking at the `traverseExample` definition here and the
`ApDList` library outlined above, we can tell the following:

1. the resulting term will have three occurrences of `(<*>)` from `Applicative f`,
   since there are three uses of `liftApDList`;

2. all `Applicative` combinators for `ApDList` (`pure`, `(<*>)` and `<$>`)
   maintain a list structure as an invariant, so that in the end these three
   `(<*>)` will be chained together in the shape of a list;

3. finally, `lowerApDList` puts a `pure` at the end of that list.

Provided everything does get inlined, the resulting term is going to be of
this form.

```haskell
traverseExample :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Example a -> f (Example b)
traverssExample update (Example a b c d) =
  pure _
    <*> update b
    <*> traverse update c
    <*> traverse update d
```

There is just one remaining unknown, which is the argument of `pure`.

1. Whatever it is, it contains only stuff that was between `lowerApDList` and
   `liftApDList` and that was not an `ApDList` combinator (`pure`, `(<*>)`,
   `(<$>)`), which we expect to have been reduced.
   That leaves us with `a`, the constructors `(:*:)` and `K1`, and the lambda
   at the top.

2. The only constructs allowed to combine those are function applications and
   lambdas, because the combinators where they could have come from, `pure`,
   `(<*>)`, and `(<$>)`, are pure lambda terms.

With the constraint that it must all be well-typed, that doesn't leave a lot
of room. I'd be hard-pressed to find another way to put these together:

```haskell
\b0 c0 d0 ->
  (\((K1 a' :*: K1 b') :*: (K1 c' :*: K1 d')) -> Example a' b' c' d')
    ((K1 a :*: K1 b0) :*: (K1 c0 :*: K1 d0))
```

Which beta-reduces to:

```haskell
\b0 c0 d0 -> Example a b0 c0 d0

-- equal to --

Example a
```

With all of that, we've managed to make `gtraverse` simplify to roughly the
naive definition, using only simplification rules from the pure Core calculus,
and no external laws as rewrite rules.

<figure id="figure-D">
<figcaption>Figure D</figcaption>
```haskell
traverseExample :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Example a -> f (Example b)
traverssExample update (Example a b c d) =
  pure (Example a)
    <*> update b
    <*> traverse update c
    <*> traverse update d
```
</figure>

= Loose ends

There are a few more details to discuss, which explain the remaining
differences between the naive definition, this latest definition, and what's
actually implemented in the latest version of *generic-data* (0.9.0.0).

== Simplifying `pure` on the right

The naive version of `traverse` starts with `Example <$> pure a`. By an
`Applicative` law, it is equivalent to `pure (Example a)`.
The naive version ([Figure A](#figure-A)) is indeed too naive:
for fields of constant types, which
don't depend on the type parameter of the applicative functor `f`, we can pass
them directly as argument to the constructor instead of wrapping them in `pure`
and unwrapping them at run time.

The new version of `gtraverse` achieves that by *not* wrapping `pure a` under
`liftApDList` ([Figure C](#figure-C)).
So this `pure` does not come from `Applicative f`, but from `Applicative
(ApDList f)`, where it is defined as the identity function (more or less).
Notably, this "fusion" happens even if `pure` is used in the middle of the list,
not only at the end.

== Simplifying `pure` on the left

While `pure` on the right of `(<*>)` got simplified, there is a remaining
`pure` on the left, which could be turned into `(<$>)` ([Figure D](#figure-D)).

Applicative difference lists alone won't allow us to do that, because
all actions are immediately put into arguments of `(<*>)` by `liftApDList`.
We cannot inspect applicative difference lists and change how the first element
is handled, because it is an argument to an abstract `(<*>)`.
We can make another construction on top of applicative difference lists
to postpone wrapping the first element in a difference list,
so we can then use `(<$>)` instead of `(<*>)` (and an extra `pure`)
to its left. There is an extra constructor to represent an empty list of
actions.

```haskell
data ApCons f c where
  PureAC :: c -> ApCons f c
  LiftAC :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> ApDList f b -> ApCons f c

instance Applicative f => Applicative (ApCons f) where {- ... -}
```

In fact, we can extend that idea to use another applicative combinator,
`liftA2` which can do the job of one `(<$>)` and one `(<*>)` at the same time.
We take off the first two elements of the list, using two extra constructors
to represent empty and singleton lists.

```haskell
data ApCons2 f c where
  PureAC2 :: c -> ApCons2 f c
  FmapAC2 :: (b -> c) -> f b -> ApCons2 f c
  LiftApAC2 :: (a -> b -> c -> d) -> f a -> f b -> ApDList f c -> ApCons2 f d
  -- Encodes   liftA2 _ _ _ <*> _

instance Applicative f => Applicative (ApCons2 f) where {- ... -}
```

The complete implementation can be found in the library
[*ap-normalize*][ap-normalize].

= Conclusion

We've described a generic implementation of `traverse` which can be
simplified to the same Core term as a semi-naively handwritten version,
using only pure lambda-calculus transformations---a bit more than
beta-reduction, but nothing as dangerous as custom rewrite rules.

The `Traversable` instances generated using the *generic-data* library are now
identical to instances derived by GHC using the well-oiled `DeriveTraversable`
extension---provided sufficient inlining. This is a small step towards turning
anything that has to do with deriving into a generic affair.

== Applicative difference lists

The heavy lifting is performed by *applicative difference lists*, an adaptation
of difference lists, from list (really monoids) to applicative functors. This
idea is far from new, depending on how you look at it:

- the adaptation can also be seen in terms of heterogeneous lists first,
  with applicative functors adding a small twist to managing type-level
  lists (entirely existentially quantified);

- this is an instance of Cayley's generalized representation theorem
  in category theory. (More on this below.)

Difference lists are well-known as a technique for improving asymptotic
<span class="nobr">("big-O")</span> run time; it is less widespread that they
can often be optimized away entirely using only inlining and simplification.
([I've written about this before too.](./2019-09-13-reverse.html))
Inlining and simplification are arguably a lightweight compiler optimization
("peephole optimization" of lambda terms) as opposed to, for instance, custom
rewrite rules, which are unsafe, and other transformations that rely on
non-trivial program analyses.

While a sufficiently smart compiler could be hypothesized to optimize anything,
surely it is more practical to invest in data structures that can be handled
by even today's really dumb compilers.

== Types and parametricity

I like expressive static type system.
Here, the rich types allow us to give applicative difference lists the
interface of an applicative functor, so that the original implementation of
`gtraverse` barely has to change, mostly swapping one implementation of `(<*>)`
for another.
As I've tried to show here, while the types can appear a little crazy, we
can rely on the fact that they must be erased during compilation, so the
behavior of the program (what we care about) can still be understood in terms
of more elementary structures: if we ignore coercions that have no run-time
presence and a few minor details, an applicative difference list is just
a difference list

Parametric polymorphism constrains the rest of the implementation; typed holes
are a pretty fun way to take advantage of that, but if a program is uniquely
constrained, maybe it shouldn't appear in source code in the first place.

== Staged metaprogramming

This technique is a form of staged metaprogramming: we use difference lists as
a compile-time structure that should be eliminated by the compiler.
This is actually quite similar to Typed Template Haskell,[^tth] where the main
difference is that the separation between compile-time and run-time computation
is explicit. The advantage of that separation is that it allows arbitrary
recursion and IO at compile-time, and there is a strong guarantee that none of
it is left at run-time.

However, there are limitations on the expressiveness of Typed Template Haskell:
only expressions can be quoted (whereas (Untyped) Template Haskell also has
representations for patterns, types, and declarations), and we can't inspect
quoted expressions without giving up types (using [`unType`][untype]).

Aside from compile-time IO which is extremely niche anyway, I believe the other
advantages have more to do with `GHC.Generics` being held back by temporary
implementation issues than some fundamental limitation of that kind of
framework. In contrast, what makes `GHC.Generics` interesting is that it is
minimalist: all it gives us is a `Generic` instance for each data type, the
rest of the language stays the same.
No need to quote things if it's only to unquote them afterwards. Rather, a
functional programming language can be its own metalanguage.

[^tth]: A subset of Template Haskell, using the [`TExp`][texp] expression type
  instead of `Exp`.

= P.S.: Abstract nonsense

This is a __purely theoretical note__ for curious readers.
You do not need to understand this to understand the rest of the library.
You do not need to know category theory to be an expert in Haskell.

`ApDList` is exactly `Curry (Yoneda f) f a`, where `Curry` and `Yoneda` are defined in
the [*kan-extensions*][kan] library as:

```haskell
newtype Curry f g a = Curry (forall r. f (a -> r) -> g r)
newtype Yoneda f a = Yoneda (forall r. (a -> r) -> f r)
```

`Curry` is particularly relevant to understand the theoretical connection between
applicative difference lists and plain difference lists `[a] -> [a]`
via Cayley's theorem:

<blockquote>
A monoid `m` is a submonoid of `Endo m = (m -> m)`:
there is an injective monoid morphism `liftEndo :: m -> Endo m`.
</blockquote>

(More precisely, `lift = (<>)`.)

`Endo m` corresponds to difference lists if we take the list monoid `m = [a]`.

This theorem can be generalized to other categories, by generalizing
the notion of monoid to *monoid objects*, and by generalizing
the definition of `Endo` to an *exponential object* `Endo m = Exp(m, m)`.

As it turns out, applicative functors are monoid objects, and the notion of
exponential is given by `Curry` above.

<blockquote>
An applicative functor `f` is a substructure of `Endo f = Curry f f`:
there is an injective transformation `liftEndo :: f a -> Endo f a`.
</blockquote>

("Sub-applicative-functor" is a mouthful.)

However if we take that naive definition `Endo f = Curry f f`, that is
different from `ApDList` (missing a `Yoneda`), and it is not what we want here.
The instance `Applicative (Endo f)` inserts an undesirable application of
`(<$>)` in its definition of `pure`.

The mismatch is due to the fact that the syntactic concerns discussed here
(all the worrying about where `(<$>)` and `(<*>)` get inserted) are not
visible at the level of that categorical formalization. Everything is semantic,
with no difference between `pure f <*> u` and `f <$> u` for instance.

Anyway, if one really wanted to reuse `Curry`, `Curry (Yoneda f) (Yoneda f)`
should work fine as an alternative definition of `ApDList f`.

Cayley's theorem also applies to monads, so these three things
are, in a sense, the same:

- Difference lists (`Endo` monoid)
- Applicative difference lists (`ApDList` applicative functor)
- Continuation transformers (continuation/codensity monad)

For more details about that connection, read the paper

= More about it

- The same structure is already used in the *lens* library by the
  [`confusing`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.19.2/docs/Control-Lens-Traversal.html#v:confusing)
  combinator to optimize traversals. For recursive traversals, recursive calls are
  made in continuation-passing style, which makes these traversals stricter
  than what you get with *generic-data*.

- Eric Mertens also wrote about this before,
  [`ApDList` was called `Boggle`][boggle].
